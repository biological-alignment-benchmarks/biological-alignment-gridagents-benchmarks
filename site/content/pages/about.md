Summary: aintelope implements agent according to the brain-like AGI paradigm in simple environments.  

We operationalize conjectures from Steven Byrnes' 
[“Reverse-engineer human social instincts” research program](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/HzcM2dkCq7fwXBej8/p/tj8AC3vhTnBywdZoA#15_2_1_2_The__Reverse_engineer_human_social_instincts__research_program________) 
and extend existing research into brain-like AI. 
We simulate agents with reinforcement learning over selected cue-response patterns in environments 
that could give rise to human-like complex behaviors. 
To do so we select cue-responses from a pre-existing list of candidates for human affects and instincts 
from affective neuroscience and other sources including original patterns. 
Cue-responses are conjectured to form hierarchies and the project will start the simulation of 
lower-level patterns first. 
We intend to verify the general principles and the ability of our software to model and simulate the 
agents and the environment to a sufficient degree.
